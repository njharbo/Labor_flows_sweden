\section{Conclusion}

This paper decomposes the total variation in unemployment in Sweden, where the labor market is dual and the convergence to steady state is slow. In doing so, we make two methodological contribution to the literature. First, we extend existing decomposition methods in the literature by allowing for an arbitrary number of labor market states. This is helpful in order to analyze the Swedish labor market, where both temporary and permanent contracts exists. Second, in this setting we allow for non steady state dynamics. This is important in a Swedish context, due to low flows between states and consequently a slow rate of convergence towards the steady state.

Using this setup we show that the contribution to unemployment variability from in- and outflow from unemployment is roughly 50/50. This echoes previous findings \cite{Elsby2013}, but we further show that that temporary contrasts accounts for roughly 40 \% of at the total variation: 19 \% via the flow from unemployment to temporary employment and 18 \% via the flow from temporary employment to unemployment. This is substantial given that only 15-18 \% of the population aged 16-64 is employed on temporary contracts. We also show that properly accounting for out of steady state dynamics is paramount. Indeed, applying the standard decomposition from the literature, which relies on an assumption of fast convergence to steady state, substantially underestimates the contributions stemming from temporary contracts. We think this point is very relevant for existing studies that decompose the variability in unemployment in a European context \citep{Silva2013, Hairault2015}.
